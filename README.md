This script takes MP3 audio file and mutes part of it in a psecified interval and duration.
The script was created in order to bypass Facebook's Copyright blocks when uploading a video with music 
that is protected with copyright notice.

The tool circuments the audo aduio recognizer by addng very short mutes during the song that prevent from the recognizer
from identifying the song and put restrictions on the whole video it was included in.
